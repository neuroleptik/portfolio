# Portfolio
Here you can find my portfolio code displayed at : https://jean-baptiste-brasselet.fr/

# HTML
I coded all HTML files from scratch, there is no javascript.
  
# CSS
I picked a simple boostrap css, you can find the style at : https://getbootstrap.com/

# PHP
I only inserted one php file. It is just a simple mail function that I have securized from script injections.

# SSL and HTTPS
Even if there is no risk for data because it is just a showcase website, I have setted up a free SSL encryption certificate. That's why there is https writed on the beginning of the URL
